# Day 1–2 – Python Basics for AI 🚀

This repository documents the first steps of my 90-day Artificial Intelligence learning journey.

## What I’ve completed so far
- ✅ Installed Python and VS Code
- ✅ Learned Python numbers and strings
- ✅ Worked with lists and dictionaries
- ✅ Used conditional logic (`if / else`)
- ✅ Practiced proper Python indentation
- ✅ Uploaded and versioned code using GitHub

## Files in this repository
- `hello_ai.py` – First Python script (Day 1)
- `python_basics.py` – Python fundamentals used in AI (Day 2)

## Goal of this repository
Build strong Python foundations before moving into machine learning and AI models.

## Next steps
- Learn loops (`for` and `while`)
- Practice repetition and data iteration
- Prepare for AI-style data processing

- Learn loops and iteration (Day 3)

- - Learned while loops and loop control (Day 4)

## Day 5 – Functions
Learned how to create reusable functions, use parameters, and return values. 
This is the foundation of decision-making logic used in AI systems.

## Day 6 – Decision Making
Learned how to combine loops and decision rules to process multiple data points across domains (music, health, finance, education, daily life). Built a reusable multi-domain decision function similar to AI pipelines.

## Day 7 – Mini AI Pipeline
Built a complete AI-style pipeline that takes raw input data, processes it through decision functions, and outputs results across multiple domains (music, health, finance).
