# Day 1–2 – Python Basics for AI 🚀

This repository documents the first steps of my 90-day Artificial Intelligence learning journey.

## What I’ve completed so far
- ✅ Installed Python and VS Code
- ✅ Learned Python numbers and strings
- ✅ Worked with lists and dictionaries
- ✅ Used conditional logic (`if / else`)
- ✅ Practiced proper Python indentation
- ✅ Uploaded and versioned code using GitHub

## Files in this repository
- `hello_ai.py` – First Python script (Day 1)
- `python_basics.py` – Python fundamentals used in AI (Day 2)

## Goal of this repository
Build strong Python foundations before moving into machine learning and AI models.

## Next steps
- Learn loops (`for` and `while`)
- Practice repetition and data iteration
- Prepare for AI-style data processing
